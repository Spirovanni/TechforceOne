7. Creating an admin user
First weâ€™ll need to create a user who can login to the admin site. Run the following command:

    `$ python3 manage.py createsuperuser`

    Enter your desired username and press enter.

    Username: admin
    You will then be prompted for your desired email address:

    Email address: admin@example.com
    The final step is to enter your password. You will be asked to enter your password twice, the second time as a confirmation of the first.

    Password: **********
